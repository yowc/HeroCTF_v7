Steganography is the practice of concealing information. It involves hiding data within an ordinary, non-secret file or message to prevent detection. The hidden information is being extracted at the receiving end. Often, steganography is combined with encryption to add an extra layer of security for the hidden data. With the help of Steganography, we can hide any digital content virtually like text, image, videotape, etc.

The term "steganography" is derived from the Greek word "steganos" which means "hidden or covered" and "graph" means "to write." It has been in use for centuries. For example, in ancient Greece, people carved messages onto wood and covered them with wax to hide it. Similarly, Romans used different types of invisible inks which could be revealed when exposed to heat or light. Here is your flag: Hero{M4YB3_TH3_L4ST_LSB?}
